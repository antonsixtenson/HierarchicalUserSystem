## More info

This is a system for handling registration requests. When an institution is registered it can accept or deny registration requests from Users (Admin and Regulars).
There are three types of Users. <br><br>

<b>Structure:</b>

Institution<br>
    |<br>
  Admin<br>
    |<br>
 Regular<br><br>
 
 In this way the top layer (Institution) can stop misuse and faulty registrations.
